monster AI
  will change strategy if hit enough times within a short period
    ex.
      losing a lot of health with a lot of hits in a short time causes it to be defensive
      player is close to death, trigger aggression or trade strats
      barrage of hits connect, but low damage: triggers riskier strats
        landing hits with high % damage: trigger frequency
        player heals: rush consecutive hits
        
    each AI has a reaction speed stat
      under the hood its the interval between snapshots taken of the world
        snapshots include current target(s) and self position, equipment, velocity, aim (prediction - normdist arc angle)
        calculate wait time before next snapshot
          normal distribution

    each AI has a commit speed stat
      under the hood its the time between deciding a strat then acting on it
      normal distribution
      
    after choosing a strat, set a minimal time to maintain it
      then a percent chance to maintain and percentages of changing to other strats
